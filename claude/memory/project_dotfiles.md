This is a personal macOS dotfiles repo managed by Martin Chen.

**Shell:** zsh with Starship prompt (Catppuccin Mocha theme), zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting. No Oh My Zsh — plugins sourced directly via Homebrew.

**Prompt:** Starship (`starship/starship.toml`) with a powerline-style layout: OS icon → username → directory → git branch/status on the left; language versions (Node, Python, Java, Rust, Go) on the right. Uses Catppuccin Mocha palette.

**Terminal:** Ghostty with MapleMono NF CN font, Catppuccin Mocha theme, `copy-on-select = clipboard`, `shell-integration-features = no-title` (tab titles managed manually via zsh precmd).

**Package management:** Homebrew via `brew/Brewfile` (common) + machine-specific `~/.Brewfile.personal` or `~/.Brewfile.work`. Key brews: fd, fzf, gh, starship, jq, lazygit, node, ripgrep, yazi, zellij, zoxide, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting. Casks: `font-maple-mono-nf-cn`, `maccy` (clipboard manager), `shottr` (screenshot tool). Work-specific adds: awscli, telnet, tmate, cloudflared, helm, k3d, etc.

**Multiplexer:** Zellij (replaced tmux). Config at `zellij/config.kdl` → `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`.

**Claude Code:** `claude/statusline.sh` symlinked to `~/.claude/statusline.sh`. Requires manual addition of `statusLine` config to `~/.claude/settings.json` (see README).

**Setup script:** `setup.sh` — runs Brewfiles, installs global npm packages, and symlinks all configs (zsh, git, starship, ghostty, vscode, cursor, zellij, claude statusline). VS Code custom icon: `vscode/apply-icon.sh` is made executable but NOT auto-applied or installed as a launchd agent (removed because it broke VS Code's code signature on updates). Run manually after VS Code updates.

**Machine-specific overrides:** `~/.zshrc.personal` and `~/.zshrc.work` sourced at end of `.zshrc`. Brewfiles follow the same pattern.

**History:** `INC_APPEND_HISTORY` (append immediately), `SHARE_HISTORY` disabled (no cross-session sharing).

**Why:** Clean separation of personal vs. work config; Starship was re-added after a revert (commit history shows Starship → revert → re-add with full Catppuccin config).
**How to apply:** When suggesting prompt/shell changes, work within the Starship + Catppuccin Mocha aesthetic. Machine-specific config goes in `~/.zshrc.personal` or `~/.zshrc.work`, not in the dotfiles repo itself.
